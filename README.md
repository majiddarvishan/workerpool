Would you like me to also sketch out a Makefile + docker-compose.yml so you can spin up the pool + Prometheus + Grafana stack in one shot for local observability testing?


## ðŸ”‘ How to use

- make build â†’ builds the example binary
- make run â†’ runs the example directly
- make test â†’ runs all tests under ./...
- make tidy â†’ cleans up go.mod and go.sum
- make clean â†’ removes the built binary
- make run-metrics â†’ runs the example and exposes Prometheus metrics at http://localhost:2112/metrics
